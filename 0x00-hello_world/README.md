# Hello, World

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Holberton School. It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language.

# General
* Why C programming is awesome
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type ```gcc main.c```
* What is an entry point
* What is ```main```
* How to print text using ```printf```, ```puts``` and ```putchar```
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using ```gcc```
* What is the default program name when compiling with ```gcc```
* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with ```betty-style```
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the ```main``` function influence the return value of the program

# Requirements

# C
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ```gc```c, using the options ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* All your files should end with a new line
* A ```README.md``` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use ```system```
* Your code should use the ```Betty style```. It will be checked using ```betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl```
* 
# Shell Scripts
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (```$ wc -l file``` should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/bin/bash```

| File name | Description |
